## Hello There ‚ú®üßô‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

My name is Mika. I'm currently taking a course in ICT in the Netherlands, and this Git will hold some the projects I work on!
My pronouns are He/Him and I was born in July 2003, do the math.

Interested to collab on any HTML and CSS webpage projects, learning about basically everything else.

Excited to finally know how Github works!
