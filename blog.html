                <h1>Study Motivation</h1>
                <p>If you’d asked me years ago what my motivation was to get into the field of IT, like, back when I was maybe 10 years old, I would’ve told you  that it was because it’s what my dad does. Since then, I’ve learnt a little better why I actually care about this field and am interested in it.</p>

                <h1>SWOT analysis</h1>
                <p>We all had to fill in a SWOT analysis as a part of the application process. A SWOT analysis works you through a series of questions to determine your Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities and Threats. This allows you to figure out in what regards you’re already and in what regards you could grow to improve.</p>

                <p>Personally, I haven’t got a lot of experience in the world of coding. I’ve had my funks of curiosity, exploring pages like <a href="http://www.code.org">code.org</a> and similar, but I’ve never sunk my teeth into any sort of major projects or languages beyond HTML and CSS.</p>

                <h1>PCO Feedback</h1>
                <p>Throughout this year and for this project, we are- and will be- receiving a lot of feedback. Taking that feedback and improving upon it is a major part of the course and something we will learn to do. Additionally, we will learn to give constructive criticism, feedback you can actually work with. Here’s some of the feedback I’ve received so far.</p>
