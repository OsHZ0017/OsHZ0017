            <h1>Study Motivation</h1>
            <p>If you’d asked me years ago what my motivation was to get into the field of IT, like, back when I was maybe 10 years old, I would’ve told you  that it was because it’s what my dad does. Since then, I’ve learnt a little better why I actually care about this field and am interested in it.</p>
            <p>Computers have always interested me, partially because my dad worked as a teacher teaching IT, partially because they just seem so blatantly complex where it nearly seems magical. As a kid, I wondered how you would even learn to write all the code that goes into a functional computer. I often still wonder.</p>
            <p>I’ve also learned I can learn that language, though. I can learn to write that code. Not very many people are able to but I can learn it, and I’d be super cool if I did learn it!</p>
            <p>I’d feel so incredibly proud of myself if I managed to finish this course and create things like the websites I use every day or even create something better, a product I want to use because I actually prefer it over whatever was the standard before I made it.</p>
            <p>Networks too, I want to learn to make the highways that people use for this digital communication. I want to not only drive on them, but understand the road signs, design the pathways and build the lanes. I think I can learn those things If I follow, and finish, this course.</p>
            <p>Growing up, I even learnt my dad doesn’t know how to code. He’s a coach for IT, I’ve surpassed his knowledge.</p>
