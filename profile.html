      <h1>Who am I?</h1>
      <p>My name is Mika van Os, I am 21 years old and have been living in Zeeland for the majority of my life, specifically in Goes.
      <br>I live with both my parents, and a younger sibling, there is a year and a half between her and me.</p>
      <p>When it comes to education, I've completed the Dutch High School system and have been granted my "HAVO" diploma, this is more or less defined as "Senior General Secondary Education", though I have to admit I haven't the faintest as to what that means exactly.</p>
      <p>I originally intended to go to an Art Academy, but was turned away wherever I applied. It's still a dream but not a realistic one. I decided to go into ICT mainly because the magic of computer coding has always enticed me, but also perhaps because it's still a better optiion than politics.</p>
      <P>I have a job delivering newspapers, which I dilligently fufill every morning with the exception of sundays.</P>

      <h2>To list some of my further hobbies</h2>
      <dl>
        <dt>Playing games</dt>
          <dd>I mainly have interest in the rythm game OSU!, but occasionally play factory builders like Shapez.io and simpler games such as Minecraft, too. I also have a VR headset which I enjoy using a lot, mainly for Beat Saber and VRChat</dd>
        <dt>LARP</dt>
          <dd>LARP stands for "Live Action RolePlay" and is a genre with wild variety. The part I most like about it is the improvised acting involved, but sadly I haven't had the chance to participate in any official events yet.</dd>
        <dt>Drawing</dt>
          <dd>You'll likely see me doodle in class. I enjoy drawing and always have, you're free to ask to see my sketchbook and I'll gladly show you it!</dd>
