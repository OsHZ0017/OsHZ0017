          <p>
            I think I'm ready to be a part of this programme, to learn more
            about the things that make me curious and actually learn to
            understand and create in this field of work.
          </p>
          <p>
            From as young as I've been aware of computers, I've been curious
            about how their internal mechanisms function. As a younger child we
            didn't exactly have a computer at home on which I was allowed to
            experiment, but I remember begging my father to let me install
            minecraft mods and doing classes and projects on
            <a href="https://code.org/">Code.org</a>
          </p>
          <p>
            He never let me, though, too afraid I'd permanently damage
            something. Which honestly, I respect.

          <h4>I think the IT course is a good fit for me because:</h4>
          <ul style="text-align: left">
            <li>It is a lot of impromptu problem solving, which I love</li>
            <li>
              It is a lot of project work, which I think is a fun challenge
            </li>
            <li>
              It is sometimes out of the box thinking, which can be silly and
              very fun
            </li>
            <li>
              It is a lot of structuring and design, learning what is intuitive
              and how to do things best is fun.
            </li>
          </ul>

            Now that I'm older and have my own money and a frontal lobe more
            capable of reasonable decisions, I'm allowed to start and
            experiment. I'm excited to learn things I didn't before, and I look
            forward an incredible amount to learning all about these languages
            that I've heard of but never learnt to read.
          </p>
          <p>
            I especially look forward to learning javascript. Perhaps in the
            future I'll be creating what I was so curious about, a Minecraft
            mod! If ever I come up with an idea decent enough.
          </p>
          <p>
            I hope all of you are just as excited as I am to go into this year
            and start learning!

          <h3>Previous project</h3>
          <p>
            I have previously worked on
            <a href="https://suunn.nl"> a website</a> before, though the
            intention of this prevous site was to look both retro and
            intentionally awful
          </p>
          <p>I can't claim I've grown a LOT since then, but maybe a little?</p>
